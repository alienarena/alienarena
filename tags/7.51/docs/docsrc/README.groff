\n+[topic]. Changes from Previous Versions

This information is for packagers and those who have a previous installation of Alien Arena.
(If this does not apply to you, it is safe to skip to the next topic: Installation.)

Version 7.51 has improved performance, bug fixes, plus new and updated game assets.
Significant changes from Version 7.50 that are related to building and installing the game are:

.nf
.in +2m
* The Open Dynamics Engine (ODE) is integrated with the main program;
  so libode is no longer a required dependency. But, g++ and libstdc++
  are required to build and link the integrated ODE.
* A configure option to disable document installation is added.
* An installation path for the icon, icondir, is added and the icon is 
  renamed to alienarena.png.
* The server terminal may be configured to support color output.
.in 0

Briefly, important differences in previous Version 7.50 are:

.nf
.in +2m
* Alien Arena 2011 uses a GNU Autotools build and install.
* The game.so shared library no longer exists. 
* All file writes go to the user's HOME directory. 
* The dedicated server has been renamed to crx-ded.
* There is an dedicated-server-only build option.
* There is an "alternate" single directory install option.
* Additional dependency: Open Dynamics Engine (libode)
  (optional in 7.51).
* Additional dependency: FreeType 2 (libfreetype).
.in
.fi

Warning: The game.so library is no longer a separate module.
If a game.so file exists in an arena/ or data1/ directory, the results are "undefined".
Configurable LIBDIR is no longer needed and is eliminated.

Attempts to write into read-only space when data is installed in a shared/ directory have been corrected.
Data file access using a configurable DATADIR is now fully supported.
There is now a botinfo/ directory in the user's HOME directory.
The default directory name for Alien Arena data in the HOME directory is .codered/.
That can be changed using an environment variable, COR_GAME.

The dedicated server was renamed to simplify program name translation using the standard configure option.
Also, the dedicated server is intended to be an integral part of the package.
We would prefer it not be distributed separately and there is no particular reason to do so.
There is a configure option, provided mostly for Game Server Providers, to disable building the client program.

The standard installation now uses the GNU Autotools methods and defaults.
In some cases, the "traditional" single directory install in the user's HOME directory may be preferred.
See the Alternate Install topic below for details.


\n+[topic]. Installation

Alien Arena uses OpenGL for 3D graphics rendering.
Alien Arena can be played on many computers. 
However, not all computers have 3D acceleration hardware and drivers with adequate performance for 3D game play.

If you are installing Alien Arena using your distribution's package manager, follow their instructions.

If you are reading this, you may have already unpacked the distribution archive (aka, "tarball") into your HOME directory.
Otherwise, the terminal command line for unpacking the archive is:
.in +2m
.nf
$ tar -xzf alienarena-<some version numbers>.tar.gz
.in
.fi
Or, using the graphical file browser, right click on the file name, and left click on "Extract Here."

If the installation fails, check the error message for required software packages that may be missing.
Alien Arena uses: X11, OpenGL, OpenAL 1.1, Ogg-Vorbis, cURL, FreeType2, and JPEG.
Version 7.50 requires Open Dynamic Engine (ODE), but Version 7.51 does not.
For Ubuntu and similar systems, see the topic, "Getting Required Packages with Synaptic", below. 

Using the terminal, change to the alienarena-7.51 directory and enter these commands:  
.nf
.in +2m
$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install
.in
.fi

For advanced configure options, see the topic, "Custom Configure Options", below.

To run:
.in +2m
$ crx
.in

Command line options to crx are NOT standard.
There is NO "--help".
They follow a format inherited from Alien Arena's Quake 2 roots.
Command line options are the same as console commands using a '+' character prefix.
The details are beyond the scope of this document;
but a simple example is:
.nf
.in +2m
$ crx +set maxclients 10
.in
.fi

By default, 'sudo make install' will install the game programs and data like this:

.nf
.in +2m
/usr/local/
.in +2m
bin/
.in +2m
crx
crx-ded  (dedicated server)
.in
share/
.in +2m
alienarena/
.in +2m
arena/
botinfo/
data1/
.in
doc/
.in +2m
alienarena/
.in +2m
<various documents>
.in -4m
icons/
.in +2m
alienarena.png
.in 0
.fi

When the program is run, a directory is created in the user HOME directory.
Various kinds of data (config files, downloaded data, custom bot setups) are written there.
The default directory name is .codered/.
That can be changed using an environment variable, COR_GAME.

For example:
.nf
.in +2m
$ export COR_GAME=/home/user/.alienarena
.in
.fi

Current settings are stored in .codered/arena/config.cfg.
For custom settings, create a file, .codered/arena/autoexec.cfg.
Details about settings are beyond the scope of this document.
Go to the websites, the forum and the IRC channel for more information.

Following installation, intermediate files generated by the build may be removed using:

.nf
.in +2m
$ make clean
.in
.fi

To uninstall the program and data that 'sudo make install' installed, run:

.nf
.in +2m
$ sudo make uninstall
.in
.fi

The uninstall procedure may not remove all files and directories.
Some manual removal may be required.


\n+[topic]. Getting Required Packages with Synaptic

Tools and packages required to build Alien Arena may not be installed.
For Ubuntu and similar systems, installing them is easy with the graphical Synaptic Package Manager.
Select the following packages.
Other packages that these depend on will be automatically selected for installation.
This list is based on Ubuntu 10.10.

.nf
.in +2m
build-essential
libx11-dev
libgl1-mesa-dev
libxxf86vm-dev
libxxf86dga-dev (optional)
libopenal-dev
libjpeg8-dev (or libjpeg62-dev)
libvorbis-dev
libcurl4-gnutls-dev
libode-dev (optional)
libfreetype6-dev
.in
.fi


\n+[topic]. Troubleshooting Tips

When the game exits, it stores settings in config.cfg.
The default location for this file is /home/<user>/.codered/arena/ (might be in .alienarena rather than .codered).
Sometimes it helps to delete config.cfg, and then re-enter menu settings.
For persistent storage of custom settings, create a file named autoexec.cfg in the same directory as config.cfg.
Settings in autoexec.cfg will override settings in config.cfg.

If the game does not run smoothly, graphics settings may need to be adjusted.
Also, a different or updated video driver may be needed.
Enable the frame rate display in the "Game Options" menu by setting "display fps" to yes.
There are settings in both the "Game Options" and "Video Options" sections that affect performance.
The maximum frame rate is set with the console variable ("cvar"), cl_maxfps.
Sometimes lowering that from the default "90" will help.
(Except for local testing, do not set cl_maxfps higher than 145).
Get more information on the Forum, Websites, and IRC channel.

If you have errors that output messages about "ODE", setting the "ragdolls" option to off in the Game Options menu may help.

There are known sound problems related to PulseAudio and OpenAL on some systems.
Check
.nf
/usr/share/doc/libopenal1/examples/alsoftrc.sample.gz
.fi 
for information on OpenAL configuration.
See the Alien Arena forum and other support forums for solutions.

The mouse may behave badly (always pointing up, for instance).
This can usually be fixed by setting the console variable (cvar), in_dgamouse, to zero.
Put this line into the autoexec.cfg file:
.nf
.in +2m
set in_dgamouse "0"
.in
.fi
Alternatively, when building the program, use this configure option:
.nf
.in +2m
--without-xf86dga
.in
.fi

For advanced users only (if you do not know what this means, do not try it):
Testing shows that some CFLAGS settings can give a little performance improvement.
Some to try, depending on system hardware are:
.nf
.in +2m
* -O3
* -march=core2 
* -msse or -msse2 or -msse3
* -fpmath=sse
.in 0
.fi


\n+[topic]. Custom Configure Options

Run '$ ./configure --help' for a list of options.
Note that many of the options are built-in and some are not meaningful or useful for Alien Arena.
Options are entered on the command line in the usual way; the help output has the details.
Refer to the GNU INSTALL document for general details.

To build the dedicated server only, use the following configure option:
.nf
.in +2m
--disable-client
.in
.fi

By default, configure produces a status message giving information on the configuration.
To hide that message, use:
.nf
.in +2m
--disable-build-status
.in
.fi

To rename the programs, use the standard configure option.
For example:
.nf
.in +2m
--program-transform-name='s/crx/alienarena/'
.in
.fi

To install to a different location, use the standard configure option.
For example:
.nf
.in +2m
--prefix=/usr/local/games
.in
.fi

To specify an installation location for the icon, use the following option.
.nf
.in +2m
--with-icondir=DIR
.in
.fi

To use the system-supplied libode, rather than the integrated ODE, use this option:
.nf
.in +2m
--with-system-libode
.in
.fi
Due to variations in the way libode may be built, this is deemed an "unsupported" option.
The integrated ODE is built using these compile options:
.nf
.in +2m
* -DdDOUBLE
* -DdTRIMESH_ENABLED
* -DdTRIMESH_OPCODE
* -DNDEBUG and -DdNODEBUG
.in
.fi
Using a libode built with -DdSINGLE makes ragdolls excessively "raggedy".
Other variations will likely result in program failure.

To disable installation of documents, use the following option.
.nf
.in +2m
--disable-documents
.in
.fi

The server terminal will output color if the following option is used.
This converts Quake-style color codes to ANSI color escapes.
(It is not enabled by default because some terminal configurations may not support ANSI color escapes.)
.nf
.in +2m
--enable-ansi-color
.in
.fi

Other Alien Arena custom options are intended mostly for developer use.
If you use them, it is assumed that you know what you are doing.


\n+[topic]. Tools

Tools/fuse.tar.gz contains a game server browser.
See documents in that package for details.

Tools/LinuxScripts contains tools for server management.
See the README there for details.


\n+[topic]. Alternate Install

This configures the installation to use the "traditional", single directory, in-place install.
It does not define DATADIR, and the executables need to be in the top game directory.
Normally, this install would be done somewhere in your HOME directory.
Root privileges would not be required to write the game data.
Currently, the configure option for renaming of the executables is not supported.

If you are a map-builder, you should use this option.
Some mapping tools may not work with the "standard" install.

If you regularly update to the latest development code from the Subversion Repository, you may prefer this option.

The two install methods are not mutually exclusive.
With some care, it is possible to use both.

The configure option is:
.nf
.in 2m
--enable-alternate-install
.in
.fi

Following the usual 'make', it requires 

.nf
.in 2m
$ make install-alternate
.in
.fi

This just copies the executables to the top game directory.
The effect of using any other 'install' make target is "undefined".
