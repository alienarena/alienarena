Steps to get web browser system up and running:

1) Make a mysql database with name of your choice, and add a user with all
   permissions to it

2) Initialise the database using the stats.sql file supplied
     
    mysql -p -h DBSERVER dbname < stats.sql

3) Edit config.php and enter the database/user details

4) Make sure the scan/scan.php is called every minute from a crontab.
   For example, my www-data user crontab contains:

* * * * * /usr/bin/php5-cgi /path-to/scan/scan.php >/dev/null 2>&1

That's it - should now be up and running.
