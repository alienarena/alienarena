Currently OU provides project files for Visual Studio 6, Visual Studio 2005
and makefile for GCC. These are located in "build" directory. 
Makefile is quite simple and may not work on some platforms. Makefile does not 
have "clean" targets and does not track header changes. Further in this file 
you can find how to delete build output files to re-run a clean build.

There is also a test project file in "test" directory that covers all the 
library functionality and allows to make sure everything is fine on 
a particular platform.

All the intermediate files are generated in "intermediate" directory.
Library output files are placed in "lib" directory.
Test binary is placed in "bin" directory.
Having these three folders deleted you can return to initial state.
