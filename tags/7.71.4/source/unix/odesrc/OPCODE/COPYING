    "Opcode is good under ODE's license"

    I didn't put a license to prevent boring questions about licenses, but it
    seems it's not enough - I still get as many questions, regarding missing
    license.

    The only thing that would NOT be good would be renaming it "TopCode",
    changing the author's name, selling it at a very expensive price, and still
    managing to make money out of it :)

    ...I should add a license explicitely against this :)
