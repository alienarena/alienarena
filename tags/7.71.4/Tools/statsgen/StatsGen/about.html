Arena Global Stats page!</font></b><font size="1"> </font>
<p><b><font size=-2 face="Arial,Helvetica">This stats program is
completely based on game standings vs other ranked players.&nbsp; It does
not matter who you kill, or how you kill them.&nbsp; If you want to improve
your standings, just play to win.</font></b><font size="1"> </font>
<p><b><font size=-2 face="Arial,Helvetica">Playing CTF will not affect
your rankings either way.&nbsp; Your frag count will go up, as will your
frags per hour, but everything is based on percentages, so it's all relative
to the game you are involved with.</font></b><font size="1"> </font>
<p><b><font size=-2 face="Arial,Helvetica">You accumulate points
in several algorithms.&nbsp; The first, and foremost, is your frags per
minute in the game is calculated against other players you are playing
on the server.&nbsp; You get awarded points for players frag percentages,
divided by their current ranking.&nbsp; In otherwords, you get more points
for being ahead of good players rather than bad.&nbsp; If you are dominating
the match, rest assured, your points will come too, as you will get points
based on the percentage of frags you have vs total frags in the game as
well.</font></b><font size="1"> </font>
<p><b><font size=-2 face="Arial,Helvetica">In order to prevent people
from just playing alot to pick up cheap points, your point totals are divided
by the time you have spent playing the game.</font></b><font size="1"> </font>
<p><b><font size=-2 face="Arial,Helvetica">As time goes on, we will
be adding new features and new interesting ways to track your progress,
so stay tuned!</font></b></td>
