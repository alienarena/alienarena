1.	INTRODUCTION

ALIEN ARENA is a fast paced arena FPS game with multiple modes, mutators and level, wrapped in a macabre sci-fi theme that harkens back to the classic themes of the 1950's.

The game features 23 levels, which can be played competitively online against other players, or practice offline against the built in AI(bots).  

Alien Arena offers Capture The Flag, All Out Assault(players can climb into randomly spawned jetpacks to do battle), and Tactical(Alien Vs Human in a battle to destroy the other's base by planting bombs and other means).  Simply go into the multiplayer menu to start a server, change the game rules , and choose a map to play on.  You can also select from a large variety of different mutators(instagib, rocket arena, excessive, low grav, regen, vampire, etc) to further customize your game experience.

Alien Arena : Many are called, only one will reign supreme.

Eternal war ravaged the vastness of infinite space. For as far back into the ages as the memories of the galaxies oldest races could reach, it had been this way. Planet at war with planet, conflicts ending with a burned cinder orbiting a dead sun and countless billions sent screaming into oblivion. War, endless and eternal, embracing all the peoples of the cosmos. Scientific triumphs heralded the creation of ever more deadly weapons until the very fabric of the universe itself was threatened.

Then came the call.

Some said it was sent by an elder race, legendary beings of terrifying power who had existed since the birth of the stars and who now made their home beyond the fringes of known creation, others whispered fearfully and looked to the skies for the coming of their gods. Perhaps it didn't matter who had sent the call, for all the people of the stars could at least agree that the call was there.

The wars were to end - or they would be ended. In a demonstration of power whoever had sent the call snuffed out the homeworld of the XXXX, the greatest empire of all the stars, in a heartbeat. One moment it was there, the next it was dust carried on the solar winds. All races had no choice but to heed the call.

For most the call was a distant tug, a whispered warning that the wars were over, but for the greatest hero of each people it was more, it was a fire raging through their blood, a call to a new war, to the battle to end all battles. That fire burns in your blood, compelling you, the greatest warrior of your people, to fight in a distant and unknown arena, your honor and the future of your race at stake.

Across the stars you traveled in search of this arena where the mightiest of the mighty would do battle, where you would stand face to face with your enemies in a duel to the death. Strange new weapons awaited you, weapons which you would have to master if you were to survive and emerge victorious from the complex and deadly arenas in which you were summoned to fight.

The call to battle beats through your heart and soul like the drums of war. Will you be the one to rise through the ranks and conquer all others, the one who stands proud as the undefeated champion of the Alien Arena?

3.	GETTING STARTED

* INSTALLATION

(Windows)

Installation has been made very simple.  After downloading, simply click on the .exe file and the installation will begin.  Follow the instructions of the program. If you are running Windows, you should have administrative privileges.  If not, you may get some errors when the program tries to write the uninstall information to the registry.  If so, simply click "ignore", and the installation will continue without problem.

Once finished, you can click on the Alien Arena icon that has been placed on your desktop.

(Linux)

See the README and INSTALL documentation files.

* BASIC COMMANDS

ALIEN ARENA works very much like Quake and Unreal Tournament, with a few notable exceptions.

The player will have the following weapons:

1.	Blaster (automatically equipped at spawn)
2.	Alien Disruptor
3.	Chaingun
4.	Flame Thrower
5.	Rocket Launcher
6.	Alien Smart Gun
7.	Disruptor
8.	Alien Vaporizer
9.	Violator (automatically equipped at spawn)
10.     Minderaser(replaces re-spawning weapon every 2 minutes)

Weapons also have alternate firing modes.  In you controls menu, select your secondary fire key and this will allow you to use these modes.  The default key for alternate fire is MOUSE2 (right click).

There are powerups such as double damage, alien force, haste and sproing.

Although the game automatically detects hardware capability on intial run, it would be advisable for you to change video settings for however you wish to view the game, and what gives you reasonable performance.  

ALIEN ARENA also allows for colored names just as Quake 3, using the ^ character followed by a number to set the color.

Movement is based on Quake 2 physics, allowing strafejumping, doublejumping, and other Quake type movements.  In Alien Arena, you can also dodge, similarly to Unreal Tournament, by pressing a strafe key, releasing it fully, and pressing it again.  Dodges can be linked together into sequences, similar to strafejumping, called strafedodging.  You can also lean around corners, and sneak silently.

* COMPLETING LEVELS

Your goal is to reach the fraglimit before your opponents, or by scoring the most frags before the time limit is up.

In CTF mode, you'll be on a team, and trying to capture the enemy's flag and return it to your own flag's location.  The team reaching the capture limit first, wins.

In Tactical, the goal is to destroy all of the components of the enemy base before they destroy yours.  As items are destroyed, defenses such as laser beams and deathrays gradually begin to malfuncion or weaken.  There are 3 classes on each team, each with different capabilities such as planting bombs, detonating them, or having a superweapon to protect the bomber/detonators.

* CONNECTING TO A SERVER

You can select "join server" from the "multiplayer" menu and select a server in the list.  Servers are listed in order of ping, with lowest ping at the top of the list.  

4.	THE CODERED ACE BOT

Bots are a built in feature of ALIEN ARENA.  Several bots are already configured for multiplayer games, and in Alien Arena, each level has a specific bot file for what bots are to be played in each level.

To add a bot, type "sv addbot name model/skin", and to remove a bot type "sv removebot name". You can also add bots in the menu, in the deathmatch/bots flags area.

In your Deathmatch options, you can configure other options such as chatting, node saving, and aiming.

These bots are fully configurable using the Botconfigurator program.  You can change their skill levels, accuracy, weapon favoring, awareness, and chat strings.

Skill level 0 bots are quite easy to beat.  Skill level 1 bots are a little tougher, and do more dodging and are more accurate.  Skill level 2 bots do more advanced dodging, rocket jumping, and are even more accurate.  Level 3 bots are extremely skilled, and will strafe, and strafe jump around the level.  They will also taunt you after killing you.  If in Alien Arena, you play the single player tournament against the bots, selecting "easy" will make all bots skill level 0.  Selecting "normal" will leave them at whatever level they are configured. Selecting "hard" will make them all move up 1 skill level.

5.	THE REWARDS SYSTEM

In Alien Arena, you are given points for getting kills (one point for kill), two points for special kills (midair kills, gib kills), and five extra points for killing sprees.  These points add up, and when these points reach the point threshold (set by the server), they can be used to purchase temporary powerups:  invisibility, haste, and sproing.  Invisibility makes you appear like glass, haste makes your jumps increase your speed dramatically (linking jumps together makes this difference even more drastic), and sproing greatly increases the player jump height.  These powerups last for 30 seconds.

6.	HOW TO UNINSTALL ALIEN ARENA

To uninstall Alien Arena, simply go to your start programs menu, select your Alien Arena folder, and click on "Uninstall".  You can also go into your control panel, and uninstall Alien Arena in the programs and software section.

For Linux users, see the README documentation file.
