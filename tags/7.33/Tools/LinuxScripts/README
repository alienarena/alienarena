'kill-runaway-crded' and 'launch-server' are shell scripts designed to emulate
running crded as a persisant service under linux.   

An example crontab that would check each server is running every ten minutes
would look like this:

*/10 * * * * /home/aa/cron/kill-runaway-crded
*/10 * * * * /home/aa/cron/launch-server ctf.cfg     >/dev/null 2>&1
*/10 * * * * /home/aa/cron/launch-server teamdm.cfg  >/dev/null 2>&1

Additonally, a master server would have the following line in the crontab
(most people won't want this):

*/10 * * * * /home/aa/cron/check-master >/dev/null 2>&1 

Don't forget to edit the launch-server/check-master scripts to set the paths
correctly for your executable.

'svstat' is a ruby script that will query local servers and produce some nice
output for server admin.

'rcon' is a ruby script that sends rcon commands to servers
