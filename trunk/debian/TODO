TODO's for Debian packaging

* Add more translations for alienarena2007.desktop.
* Either create patches or change upstream source so that the server binary uses the server.so shared library instead of game.so.
* Resolve all issues with copyright files, especially dealing with the License notices.
* Look into issue with postrm scripts dealing with $HOME.
* Resolve issue of whether the game data files will be seperated from game client and server when distributed through Debian.
