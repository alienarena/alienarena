Installing
==========

    To use the browser you will need these components installed:

    - Ruby
    - GTK
    - Ruby-GTK bindings
    - Glade

    Debian distros (Ubuntu)
    -----------------------

    All the required components can be installed using one command:

        sudo apt-get install ruby-gnome2

    Gentoo distros
    --------------
	
        emerge ruby-gnome2

    Others
    ------

    For all other systems (including windows), check:
    http://ruby-gnome2.sourceforge.jp/hiki.cgi?Install+Guide

Running the application
=======================

    ...is as simple as this (in the RubyBrowser directory):

        ./browser.rbw

    (you might even want to rename the file to "browser" as the rbw extension is
    only present to assist Windows users).

Configuring the application
===========================

    Once the application has been run, a browser.ini file will appear in the
    directory.   Edit this to select your favorite web browser and the location
    of the crx executable, if different from the defaults.
