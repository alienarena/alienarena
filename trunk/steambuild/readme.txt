Steps to create an alien arena build for Steam on linux, using the steam runtime.

Remarks about the ODE folder:
To be able to build AND ragdolls to work correctly, I had to copy all header files to a local folder.
The following did NOT work:

a. Environment variable for include path C_INCLUDE_PATH="/usr/include".
It compiles, but ragdoll animations aren't shown, instead, the screen freezes.
b. -I/usr/include in makefile, it just can't find the ode header files and it doesn't compile
c. Creating a symbolic link in build called "ode", pointing to "/usr/include/ode". Same result as a.

Status May 2023:
- Skipped the ODE related steps entirely this time.
- Got error with ld (binutils) in step 12:

libgame.a -pthread -lXxf86vm -lX11 -lfreetype -lcurl -ljpeg -lvorbisfile -lvorbis -logg -lz -lm -ldl -lrt src/libode.a -lstdc++
/usr/bin/ld: BFD (GNU Binutils for SteamRT) 2.22 internal error, aborting at ../../bfd/reloc.c line 443 in bfd_get_reloc_size

/usr/bin/ld: Please report this bug.

collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status
make: *** [Makefile:349: alienarena.x86_64] Error 1

current version of ld is 2.34, already latest version on ubuntu 20.04


Installation steps
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

a. Download steamworks sdk from here:
https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/sdk

b. Install it from .../sdk/tools/linux/setup.sh

c. Download steam runtime from here:
https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steam-runtime

Use git clone https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steam-runtime to install in ~/steam-runtime


Build preparation steps, not needed every time
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. Open a terminal

Obsolete (seems not needed at all anymore):
  4. Run 64-bit shell (assuming you installed it in ~/sdk):
    > ~/sdk/tools/linux/shell-amd64.sh

5. Setup Steam Runtime chroot (assuming you downloaded it in ~/steam-runtime):

> sudo ~/steam-runtime/setup-chroot.sh --amd64

Seems this isn't needed everytime.

Skipped:
   6. Install libode-dev under steam runtime
     (if this is not in your home folder but on another partition you might need to add it to /etc/schroot/default/fstab)
     > sudo schroot --chroot steamrt_scout_amd64 -- apt-get install libode-dev

7. If needed, copy any changed header files from /usr/include/ode to steambuild/ode
and from unix/minizip to steambuild/minizip.

8. If needed, create a new config.h in the build folder.
Create it by running configure again for a normal non-steam build, and copy the new config.h to the build folder.
If you recreated it, make sure to add the following to it:

/* Steam version */
#define STEAM_VARIANT 1

9. Make sure debug_build=no inside the makefile.
If not, there will be issues with the console making you look down, and exclusive fullscreen not working.


Build steps
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
10. cd into the steambuild folder

11. Do a make clean
> make clean

12. Make
> sudo schroot --chroot steamrt_scout_amd64 -- make -j 4

13. Copy alienarena.x86_64 to the steam folder to test it
